# Global Energy Trends A Comprehensive Analysis of Key Regions and Generation Modes Using Power-BI
🌍 Global Energy Trends Analysis Using Power BI

A comprehensive data analytics project that explores global energy consumption and power generation trends across countries, continents, and energy sources using Power BI dashboards.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical global energy data to identify key consumption patterns, compare renewable and non-renewable energy sources, and visualize regional energy trends. Interactive dashboards are built to support data-driven insights for sustainable energy planning.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze country-wise and continent-wise energy consumption

Identify top energy-consuming regions and countries

Compare renewable vs non-renewable energy sources

Study long-term power generation trends

Build interactive Power BI dashboards for insights
